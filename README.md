# Evolutionary Computation
Biomimicry, the imiation of nature for solving human problems has produced many examples of world class design. Evolutionary Computing is an upcoming form of machine learning which takes its inspiration from nature in this way.

This repository contains the code for the implementation of a genetic algorithm as part of an open assessment for my evolutionary computing module. The report that complements this implementation is also included.
